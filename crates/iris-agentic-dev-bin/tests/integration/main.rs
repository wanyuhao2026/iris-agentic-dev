//! Aggregated integration-test target for the binary crate.
//!
//! These 15 files were 15 separate `[[test]]` targets. Cargo runs test binaries one after another,
//! so each was a process spawn charged to every run whether or not any of its tests were selected.
//! As modules of one binary they spawn once.
//!
//! Most of these spawn `iris-agentic-dev` as a subprocess or talk to the live `iris-dev-iris`
//! container, so they stay serial: run them with `--test-threads=1`. Tests in the same target now
//! share a process, which means a `set_var` in one is visible to the next.
//!
//! Add a file here and add its `mod` line below, or it will not run — the aggregator is the only
//! thing that pulls these in.
