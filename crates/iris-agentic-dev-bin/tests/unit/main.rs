//! Aggregated unit-test target for the binary crate.
//!
//! These 10 files were 10 separate `[[test]]` targets. Cargo never runs test binaries in parallel,
//! so each one cost a process spawn charged to every run — the same tax that put 85% of a warm
//! core-crate run into starting processes rather than running tests. As modules of one binary they
//! spawn once and the in-binary tests run on all cores.
//!
//! Add a file here and add its `mod` line below, or it will not run — the aggregator is the only
//! thing that pulls these in. The core crate's `tests/unit/test_test_target_layout.rs` reaches
//! across into this crate and fails when a file is missing its line.
