//! The source-side half of the parameter contract.
//!
//! Every schema assertion in this feature compares what a tool *advertises* against what its
//! handler *reads*. The advertised side comes from a running server (`tools/list`); the read side
//! comes from these two helpers, which scan the source. Both are in
//! `iris_agentic_dev_core::testing` because eight test targets share them and every test file in
//! this crate is its own cargo target with no shared module.
//!
//! This file exists to prove the helpers work before anything depends on them. A source-scanning
//! helper that quietly returns an empty set turns every comparison into a tautology, which is the
//! failure mode `read_keys` panics rather than tolerates.
