//! Write and destructive gate resolution, classification, and enforcement.
//!
//! The gate used to travel through a process-global environment variable
//! (`IRIS_WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED`), exported from the config loader only when the variable was
//! not already set. That made it write-once per process: an operator who edited
//! `write_tools_enabled` from `true` to `false` kept seeing `true` forever, and two readers
//! interpreted an absent variable with opposite defaults. Enforcement was a four-line preamble
//! copy-pasted into six handlers, so every write-capable tool added since was ungated by
//! omission.
//!
//! This module replaces both halves of that with data:
//!
//! - [`resolve_gates`] is a pure function. No `std::env` reads, no IO, no clock. Precedence is
//!   the [`GateSource`] variant order, and the operator's environment arrives as an
//!   [`OperatorEnvGates`] parameter, which is what makes the "operator already set it" branch
//!   reachable from a test.
//! - [`CLASSIFICATION`] is a const table naming every registered tool and its [`WriteClass`],
//!   with per-action overrides for tools that both read and write. Completeness is asserted by
//!   test against `IrisTools::registered_tool_names()`, so a new tool cannot ship unclassified.
//!
//! Enforcement happens once, in `ServerHandler::call_tool`, before anything touches IRIS.
//!
//! Spec: `specs/085-write-gate-integrity/`.
