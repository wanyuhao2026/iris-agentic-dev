# Connecting to IRIS

iris-agentic-dev connects to IRIS via the Atelier REST API — the same API the VS Code
ObjectScript extension uses. No special IRIS configuration is required beyond what you
already have for VS Code.

**If something isn't working, call `check_config` first** — it shows exactly which
connection source won, what host/port/namespace was resolved, and whether Atelier REST
is available. No IRIS network calls are made; it always succeeds.

```text
Call check_config and show me the result.
```

Or from the terminal:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev tool check_config --args '{}'
```

## Native IRIS on Windows or Linux (no Docker)

Run `iris-agentic-dev init` in your project root to generate a documented
`.iris-agentic-dev.toml` template with all available options:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev init
```

Or create it manually:

Add a `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` file to your project root:

```toml
host = "localhost"
web_port = 80        # IIS default for IRIS 2024.1+; use 52773 for pre-2024.1
namespace = "USER"
username = "_SYSTEM"
password = "SYS"
```

`port` is accepted as an alias for `web_port` — both are equivalent in the toml file.

### Port reference

| IRIS version        | Web server               | Default port |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| 2024.1+ on Windows  | IIS                      | 80           |
| 2024.1+ on Linux    | Apache                   | 80           |
| Pre-2024.1 (any OS) | Private Web Server (PWS) | 52773        |

### Windows IIS: `/api` web application required

This is the most common failure on Windows. IIS needs an explicit `/api` web application
mapped to the IRIS Web Gateway module. Without it, `/api/atelier` returns 404 — even when
the Management Portal loads correctly.

**To fix:**

1. Open **IIS Manager** → expand your server → **Sites** → **Default Web Site**
2. Right-click → **Add Application**. Set alias: `api`, physical path:
   `C:\InterSystems\IRIS\CSP\bin` (adjust to your install path)
3. Add a wildcard script handler mapping: executable = `CSPms.dll`, no verb restriction
4. Verify `CSP.ini` contains an `[APP_PATH:/api]` section

See the [`iris-windows-iis-setup` skill](../skills/skills/iris-windows-iis-setup/SKILL.md)
for full step-by-step instructions with verification commands.

**`localhost` vs `127.0.0.1`**: On some older Web Gateway builds, using `localhost` causes
a brief connection error before each request. If you see connection delays, change the
config to `host = "127.0.0.1"`.

---

## Docker (community image)

Run `iris-agentic-dev init` in your project directory — it detects any running IRIS
containers and writes `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` automatically:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev init
```

Or configure manually:

```toml
container = "myapp-iris"
namespace = "MYAPP"
```

---

## Docker (enterprise image)

Enterprise IRIS images (`intersystems/iris`, `intersystems/irishealth`) ship without a
built-in web server. Run the ISC Web Gateway container alongside IRIS:

```yaml
services:
  iris:
    image: containers.intersystems.com/intersystems/iris:2026.1
    ports: ["4972:1972"]
  webgateway:
    image: containers.intersystems.com/intersystems/webgateway:2026.1
    ports: ["52773:80"]
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "/init.sh"]
    volumes: ["./webgateway-init.sh:/init.sh:ro"]
```

See the [`iris-vscode-objectscript` skill](../skills/skills/iris-vscode-objectscript/SKILL.md)
for a working `webgateway-init.sh`.

---

## VS Code Server Manager (zero-config)

If the [InterSystems Server Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=intersystems-community.servermanager)
extension is installed, iris-agentic-dev reads your server list from VS Code's
`settings.json` and resolves credentials from the OS keychain automatically — no
`.iris-agentic-dev.toml` needed.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: ../docs/images/server-manager-sidebar.png
     Show the VS Code Explorer sidebar (or the InterSystems panel — the purple ISC icon in
     the activity bar). Expand the ObjectScript or InterSystems Servers tree so at least one
     server entry is visible with its hostname/port and namespace shown. If the server shows
     a green connected indicator or a lock icon, include that. Right-click the server so the
     context menu is visible — show "Add Server", "Edit Settings", and "Reconnect" items.
     This illustrates both where servers are defined and how to reconnect if credentials
     are stale. Crop to the sidebar panel only. -->

**Single server configured:** auto-connects, no extra setup.

**Multiple servers configured:** set `IRIS_SERVER_NAME` to the map key from
`intersystems.servers`:

```bash
export IRIS_SERVER_NAME=dev-local
```

Credentials are stored under keychain service `"intersystems-server-credentials"` — the
auth provider ID used by Server Manager in all VS Code-compatible forks (Cursor, Windsurf,
VS Code Insiders). If a credential is missing, iris-agentic-dev fails fast with a message
directing you to reconnect in VS Code (right-click the server → **Reconnect**) rather than
silently falling through to other discovery sources.

> **Windows limitation:** VS Code's `SecretStorage` on Windows uses DPAPI-encrypted blobs
> stored inside VS Code's own process. Those blobs are not accessible to external processes,
> so iris-agentic-dev cannot read Server Manager credentials on Windows regardless of whether
> they are stored. Use `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` instead — see
> [Native IRIS on Windows or Linux](#native-iris-on-windows-or-linux-no-docker) above.

Use `check_config` to see which servers were detected and whether credentials resolved:

```json
{
  "server_manager": {
    "available": true,
    "servers": [
      { "name": "dev-local", "active": true, "credential_status": "resolved" }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Adding servers via iris_add_server

`iris_add_server` registers an IRIS instance in
`~/.config/iris-agentic-dev/servers.json` so it can be referenced by name in any tool
call via the `server` parameter.

**Keychain path (macOS / Windows with keychain):** the credential is stored in the OS
keychain and never written to disk.

**Headless path (Claude Desktop MCP subprocess, Remote SSH, Linux CI):** when no OS
keychain is available, the credential is stored in plaintext in `servers.json` as a
fallback. The response includes `stored_plaintext: true` and a warning:

```json
{
  "added": true,
  "stored_plaintext": true,
  "warning": "Credential stored in plaintext in servers.json — use VS Code Server Manager for production credentials.",
  "note": "Restart iad for the pool to include this server."
}
```

For production workloads, prefer VS Code Server Manager (keychain-backed) or
`.iris-agentic-dev.toml` with file permissions restricted to your user. The plaintext
fallback is intended for development and CI contexts where the OS keychain is not
available.

`iris_servers` marks entries that use the plaintext fallback with
`has_plaintext_credential: true` so you can identify them and migrate credentials when
needed.

### The servers.json file

Each entry holds the parts of one base URL plus the namespace and username to use with it.
Only `host`, `port`, `namespace`, and `username` are required; `scheme` defaults to `http`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "default": "dev",
  "servers": {
    "dev": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 52780,
      "namespace": "USER",
      "username": "_SYSTEM",
      "description": "Dev container",
      "scheme": "http"
    },
    "hs-test": {
      "host": "gateway.example.com",
      "port": 8080,
      "namespace": "HSCUSTOM",
      "username": "hsadmin",
      "web_prefix": "/hs20261"
    }
  }
}
```

You can edit the file by hand — iad picks the change up on the next call, and
`iris_reload_pool` forces it immediately. Unknown keys are ignored, so a file written by a
newer iad still loads on an older one.

### Instances behind a web gateway

`web_prefix` is the path the IRIS web server is served under. Without it, `hs-test` above
would be called at `http://gateway.example.com:8080/api/atelier/`, which is either a 404 or,
worse, some other instance sharing the gateway. With it, iad calls
`http://gateway.example.com:8080/hs20261/api/atelier/`.

This is how HealthShare instances and multi-instance gateway deployments are usually
published. If Atelier answers at a path rather than at the root, you need the prefix — the
symptom of a missing one is a 404 from every tool while the host and port look right.

Leading and trailing slashes are optional and multi-segment prefixes work, so `hs20261`,
`/hs20261/`, and `/gw/hs20261` are all fine. The value is a path only: a scheme or host in it
is refused at registration. `webServer.pathPrefix`, the VS Code Server Manager spelling, is
accepted as an alias for the same key, so a block copied out of `settings.json` loads
unchanged. `iris_import_servers` carries the prefix across automatically.

The equivalent for a server declared in `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` is `web_prefix` on the
`[instance.<name>]` block.

---

## Per-connection policy (fleet / operate mode)

Add `[policy.<server-name>]` blocks to `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` to restrict which tool
categories are permitted on a given Server Manager server:

```toml
[policy.prod]
allow = ["query", "search", "docs"]
```

Blocked calls return `error_code: "POLICY_GATE"` with the list of allowed categories.
Omit the block entirely to permit everything. Available categories: `compile`, `execute`,
`query`, `search`, `docs`, `source_control`, `debug`, `admin`, `skill`, `kb`.

### `irisAudit` — opt-in `%SYS.Audit` emission

Set `irisAudit = true` in a `[policy.<server>]` block to emit one `%SYS.Audit` record
per tool call. Off by default. The event definition must exist in `%SYS` before emission
can succeed — see [docs/agent-attribution.md](agent-attribution.md) for the one-time setup
command and the trust model.

```toml
[policy.prod]
irisAudit = true
```

For flat single-server configs (no Server Manager), use `[policy.default]` as the
catchall key:

```toml
host = "localhost"
web_port = 52780

[policy.default]
irisAudit = true
```

When emission fails (event definition absent or disabled), the tool warns once and
counts subsequent failures. The failure count appears in `check_config` as
`iris_audit_failures` when it is non-zero.

For multi-instance fleet workflows (`mode = "operate"`), see the
[ecosystem integration guide](ecosystem-integration.md) for the full `[instance.*]` config
format and role-gate behavior.

---

## Connection discovery order

iris-agentic-dev resolves the IRIS connection in this order — first match wins:

1. CLI flags (`--host`, `--web-port`, `--scheme`)
2. `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` in the workspace root
3. Environment variables (`IRIS_HOST`, etc.)
4. VS Code `settings.json` (`objectscript.conn` / `intersystems.servers`)
5. VS Code Server Manager keychain (`intersystems.servers` + OS keychain credential)
6. Running Docker containers (scored by workspace name similarity)
7. Localhost port scan (52773, 41773, 51773, 8080)

### Discovery that needs no connection

Two paths skip resolution entirely: `tool --list` and `tool <name> --schema` read the tool
router, not IRIS. A harness can enumerate the surface and read a tool's parameters before it
has a container, credentials, or a reachable port — useful when the thing being set up is the
connection itself. Every other `tool` invocation resolves a connection as above and fails with
the usual diagnostic when it cannot. See [Discovery from a
shell](tools.md#discovery-from-a-shell).

| `IRIS_TLS_VERIFY`          | `true`      | Set `false` (or `0`) to skip TLS certificate validation. Same effect as `tls_verify = false` in the config file, which wins over this variable.                                               |
| `IRIS_INSECURE`            | `false`     | Blunter alias: `true` (or `1`) skips TLS certificate validation and outranks `IRIS_TLS_VERIFY`. Any other value, including a typo, means validate.                                            |
| `OBJECTSCRIPT_WORKSPACE`   | `$PWD`      | Workspace root for `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` lookup                                                                                                                                            |

| `IRIS_ENABLED_TOOLS`       | _(empty)_   | Comma-separated allowlist — when set, ONLY these tools remain, regardless of `--toolset`. Empty means no allowlist, not "expose zero tools." `IRIS_DISABLED_TOOLS` wins for any name in both. |
| `IRIS_NO_SKILLS`           | `false`     | Set to `true` to remove all skill, KB, and learning-agent tools from `tools/list` and skip `--subscribe` fetching. Equivalent to `--no-skills`.                                               |

---

## TLS certificate validation

Over `https`, certificates are validated against the **operating system** trust store, so a
gateway serving a cert from a CA you installed locally (mkcert, a corporate internal CA)
works without extra configuration. If `curl` on the same machine accepts the cert,
iris-agentic-dev does too.

To connect to a gateway whose cert cannot be validated — self-signed, expired, or a hostname
mismatch — turn validation off for that project:

```toml
# .iris-agentic-dev.toml
host = "iris.internal"
web_port = 443
scheme = "https"
tls_verify = false
```

Leave `tls_verify` out to validate. It is a connection setting, so a value in the config file
wins over `IRIS_TLS_VERIFY` in the environment — the opposite of the two tool-list variables.
`IRIS_INSECURE=true` outranks both; any unrecognised value means validate, so a typo fails
closed with a handshake error rather than quietly skipping the check.

`check_config` reports the resolved state as `tls_verify`. It makes no network calls, so this
is the only place to see that validation is off before a bad cert goes unremarked:

```json
{ "tls_verify": false }
```

---

## Global config file

Credentials you don't want to repeat in every project can go in a global config
file. Project-local `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` always takes precedence.

| Platform    | Path                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Mac / Linux | `~/.config/iris-agentic-dev/config.toml`      |
| Windows     | `%USERPROFILE%\.iris-agentic-dev\config.toml` |

```toml
# Global defaults — apply to every project that has no local .toml
username = "_SYSTEM"
password = "SYS"
```

---

## Restricting writes on shared servers

Set `write_tools_enabled = false` in `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` to put the server
in read-only mode — compile, execute, doc-write, source control, and global-write
tools all return a clear error instead of modifying anything. Query, search, and
doc-read tools continue to work.

```toml
# .iris-agentic-dev.toml on a shared dev or production server
host = "shared-iris"
web_port = 52773
namespace = "USER"
username = "_SYSTEM"
password = "SYS"
write_tools_enabled = false
```

This is the recommended default for any server that more than one person connects
to, or any server that isn't purely local.

## Tool subset (allowlist)

Restrict the tool surface to a named set:

```toml
# .iris-agentic-dev.toml
# Expose only these tools; empty means no allowlist (all tools visible)
enabled_tools = "iris_query,iris_search,iris_compile"
```

The equivalent env var is `IRIS_ENABLED_TOOLS` (see the table above). `IRIS_DISABLED_TOOLS`
wins for any name present in both lists.

See also: `provides.tools` in a project manifest (`docs/ecosystem-integration.md`) for
declaring a team-wide tool subset that installs automatically.

## Save-sync (`iris_sync` / `sync`)

`iris_sync` uploads a local file to the server and compiles it when the type needs
compiling — the VS Code ObjectScript plugin's save-on-write behavior, for agent-driven
development where nothing else watches the filesystem. The `sync` subcommand is its CLI
entry point: `sync <FILES...>` syncs named files, and `sync --hook` reads one Claude Code
PostToolUse payload from stdin, exiting 2 on failure so a compile error reaches the model
that just edited the file. Path-mapping rules and error codes are in the
[tools reference](tools.md#iris_sync).

Web files (`.csp` and static `.js`/`.css`/`.html`/`.svg`/`.json`) upload to a server path,
which cannot be guessed from a local one — an unmapped web root is refused with
`NOT_SYNCABLE` rather than uploaded somewhere wrong. Declare the mapping explicitly:

```toml
[sync]
flags = "cuk"                 # compile flags after upload, default "cuk"

[[sync.web_roots]]
local  = "src/dthealth/web"   # relative to the workspace root
server = "/dthealth/web"      # server web root, leading slash
```

## Any MCP client (Antigravity, Cline, Continue, Zed, Claude Desktop)

The VS Code extension is a convenience wrapper. The MCP server itself is one static
binary, so any client that can launch a subprocess and speak MCP over stdio can use it —
including VS Code forks whose extension gallery does not carry the extension.

**Point the client at the binary:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iris-agentic-dev": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/iris-agentic-dev",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Most clients accept that shape; the key name and file location differ (look for "MCP" or
"Tools" in the AI settings). Connection details come from `.iris-agentic-dev.toml` in the
project root, so nothing IRIS-specific belongs in the client config — though an `env` block
of `IRIS_*` variables works too if the client supports one.

**Finding the binary.** Install it standalone (Homebrew, or the
[latest release](https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-agentic-dev/releases/latest))
and use that path. If the extension already downloaded one, it is under the editor's
extension storage in a version-named subdirectory —
`<storage>/intersystems-community.iris-agentic-dev/iris-agentic-dev-<version>/iris-agentic-dev-<platform>`:

| Platform | `<storage>`                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage` |
| Linux    | `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage`                     |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage`                     |

Forks substitute their own directory for `Code` (`Cursor`, `Windsurf`, and so on). The
platform suffix is `macos-arm64`, `macos-x86_64`, `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, or
`windows-x86_64.exe`. Setting `iris-agentic-dev.serverPath` in the editor's settings points
the extension at a binary you manage instead, which also tells you where it is.

**Verify before wiring anything.** The binary answers on its own, so a failure here is a
connection problem, not a client-config problem:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev tool check_config --args '{}'
```

Then, once the client is configured, ask it: `Call check_config and show me the result.` If
the tools do not appear at all, the client never launched the binary — check its MCP log for
the command line it tried.

## HTTP transport

By default, `iris-agentic-dev mcp` communicates over stdio — the standard MCP channel
for Claude Code and similar CLI-launched clients. For AI Hub remote MCP connections
(or any client that connects via HTTP rather than launching a child process), use the
HTTP transport instead:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev mcp --transport http --port 8080
```

The server binds on `127.0.0.1:8080` and accepts MCP connections at `/mcp`. To bind
on a different address:

```bash
iris-agentic-dev mcp --transport http --port 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

**Security note:** The HTTP endpoint has no authentication. Bind to loopback
(`127.0.0.1`, the default) for local use, or put a reverse proxy in front of it if
you need auth or external access.

### AI Hub remote MCP

To connect an AI Hub agent to iris-agentic-dev over HTTP, start the server with
`--transport http`, then configure a `<Remote>` element in your ToolSet XData:

```xml
<ToolSet>
  <MCP Name="IrisAgenticDev">
    <Remote Url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"/>
  </MCP>
</ToolSet>
```

See [`contrib/aihub/README.md`](../contrib/aihub/README.md) for the full AI Hub
ToolSet setup guide.

## NoPWS — AI branch containers (2026.3+, irishealth-ai:\*)

AI branch IRIS builds (`irishealth-ai:*`, `iris-ai:*`, IRIS 2026.3+ Enterprise AI
editions) ship without an embedded web server (`WebServer=0` in `iris.cpf`). Atelier
REST is unavailable on these images, so the standard HTTP path fails with "connection
refused."

**Detect NoPWS:** Call `iris_test_server` — it reports `nopws: true` and
`nopws_detected` when it detects this condition. Or probe manually:

```bash
docker exec <container> sh -c \
  "grep -i WebServer /usr/irissys/iris.cpf 2>/dev/null || true"
```

Output `WebServer=0` confirms NoPWS.

**Configure for NoPWS:**

```toml
docker_only = true
nopws = true
container = "my-iris-ai-container"
```

Setting either `docker_only = true` or `nopws = true` activates the `docker exec`
path, bypassing Atelier REST entirely. `iris_execute` and `iris_compile` work;
tools requiring Atelier REST (`iris_doc`, `iris_source_control`) return
`NOPWS_ATELIER_REQUIRED`.

**Remote containers via SSH:**

```toml
docker_only = true
nopws = true
container = "iris-ai-prod"
ssh_host = "prodhost.internal"
```

Setting `ssh_host` routes `docker exec` through `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
<ssh_host>`. This bypasses SSH host key verification to enable non-interactive use.
Ensure you trust the remote host before setting this option.

Every `iris_execute` and `iris_compile` response includes an `execution_path` field
(`"atelier"`, `"docker_exec_local"`, or `"docker_exec_ssh"`) to confirm which path
ran. See [skills/nopws-setup](../skills/skills/iris-agentic-dev/nopws-setup/SKILL.md)
for the full setup guide.

## Windows (Docker)

The native Windows binary is not yet signed. Windows users can run iris-agentic-dev
as a Docker container instead — see [docs/windows-docker.md](windows-docker.md) for
the full setup guide and Claude Code MCP config.
